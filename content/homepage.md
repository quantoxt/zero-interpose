### 🎯 Key UX Notes
- **Pricing is optional but recommended**—reduces back-and-forth and attracts serious authors
- **All CTAs point to `/start`**, where users can select their plan or request custom scope
- **Mobile**: Pricing table becomes stacked cards on small screens
- **Performance**: No heavy JS; pricing renders statically

This homepage balances **clarity, credibility, and conversion**—without overwhelming the visitor.
