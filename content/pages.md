The following pages make up the **Zero Interpose agency marketing site** (`zerointerpose.com`). These are designed to attract authors, explain your unique value, capture leads, and build trust—without bloat.

---

## ✅ Core MVP Pages (Launch-Ready)

### 1. **Homepage (`/`)**
- Hero section:  
  > “Skip the platform. Claim your pay. Zero Interpose.”  
  > *We build direct-to-reader websites so you keep 100%—fast, fair, and forever yours.*
- CTA: **“Start Your Author Site”** → `/start`
- Brief feature highlights (coins for serials, full ownership, real-time payouts)
- Minimal footer with links to FAQ & Privacy

### 2. **Author Intake Form (`/start`)**
- 4-step guided form (as previously spec’d):
  1. About you & genre  
  2. Book status (completed / serializing / both)  
  3. Desired features  
  4. Timeline + email opt-in
- Mobile-friendly, progressive disclosure (show/hide based on answers)
- Submit → redirects to `/thank-you`

### 3. **Thank You Page (`/thank-you`)**
- Confirmation message:  
  > “Thanks, [Name]! We’ve received your request.”
- Summary of their selections (e.g., “You’re writing a serialized fantasy novel and want coin-based access.”)
- Next steps:  
  > “Expect a personalized quote and mockup within 24 hours.”
- Optional: link back to homepage

### 4. **FAQ Page (`/faq`)**
- Concise Q&A addressing top concerns:
  - _“Do I need to be tech-savvy?”_ → No, we handle everything.
  - _“How do I get paid?”_ → Directly via Stripe—no delays, no cuts.
  - _“What if my book isn’t finished?”_ → We support chapter-by-chapter access with coins.
  - _“Can I use my own domain?”_ → Yes, easily.
  - _“Who owns my reader data?”_ → You do. Always.
- Clean, expandable accordions or simple list

### 5. **How It Works (`/how-it-works`)**
- Visual walkthrough of:
  - Author dashboard  
  - Reader buying coins vs. full book

  - **Starter**: 1 completed book — $X  
  - **Serial**: Ongoing book + coins — $Y  
  - **Pro**: Multi-book + email list — $Z  
- Or keep as “Custom quote” indefinitely

### 8. **Legal Pages**

- `/terms` – Service agreement for authors  
- Required for Stripe compliance and trust

### 9. **Blog / Insights (`/blog`)**

## 🎯 Goal
Every page either **builds trust**, **explains your differentiator**, or **captures a qualified lead**.  
No fluff. No generic “About Us.” Just clarity for authors ready to take control.
