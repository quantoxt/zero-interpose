Based on the search results and known industry pain points, here is a concise bullet-point list of the key challenges authors face regarding payouts from publishing platforms:

- **Delayed royalty payments** – Payments are often processed manually or on slow cycles, leading to significant delays in authors receiving earnings .
- **Inaccurate or unclear royalty calculations** – Authors struggle with a lack of transparency in how royalties are computed, making it hard to verify what they’re owed .
- **Manual or error-prone payout systems** – Many publishers still rely on manual calculations, increasing the risk of mistakes in royalty distribution .
- **Poor documentation of royalty agreements** – Especially among small publishers, vague or missing agreements create legal vulnerabilities and disputes over payments .
- **Complex and opaque rights & royalties systems** – The evolving landscape of digital rights and territorial licensing adds layers of confusion to payout structures .
- **Lack of direct control over earnings** – Authors are dependent on platform terms, with little ability to influence payout timing, method, or transparency .
- **Industry saturation and marketing pressure** – While not a direct payout issue, the oversupply of books pushes authors to discount or promote heavily, indirectly reducing net royalties [[4], [9]].

These pain points highlight a strong market need for a platform that gives authors **direct reader relationships, transparent real-time earnings, and full control over their book sales and payouts**—which aligns perfectly with your agency’s mission.
